GoDash - Terminal Personal Productivity Dashboard

A modern terminal-based productivity dashboard that combines:
- Task management with persistent storage
- Markdown notes editor with live preview  
- Google Calendar integration with OAuth2 authentication
- Real-time weather information via wttr.in
- Beautiful, responsive terminal interface using Bubble Tea

This package contains a pre-built binary with embedded OAuth2 credentials
for immediate Google Calendar functionality - no additional setup required.

Features:
• Three-panel dashboard layout (todos, notes, calendar)
• Focus-driven navigation with mouse and keyboard support
• Automatic data persistence following XDG Base Directory spec
• Cross-platform OAuth2 flow (automatic + manual fallback)
• Markdown rendering with syntax highlighting
• Real-time weather updates for any location

Data Storage (Linux):
• Configuration: ~/.config/GoDash/
• Notes: ~/.local/share/GoDash/notes/
• Tasks: ~/.local/share/GoDash/todo-list.json
• Calendar cache: ~/.local/share/GoDash/

Quick Start:
1. Run 'godash' in your terminal
2. Enter your city for weather setup
3. Authorize Google Calendar when prompted
4. Start being productive!
