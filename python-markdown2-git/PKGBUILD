# There is some confusion between this and the community python-markdown
# That is a different immlementation. From the readme:

# "There is another Python markdown.py. However, at least at the time this
# project was started, markdown2.py was faster (see the Performance Notes)
# and, to my knowledge, more correct (see Testing Notes). That was a while ago
# though, so you shouldn't discount Python-markdown from your consideration."
