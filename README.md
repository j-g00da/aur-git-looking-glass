# AUR.git looking glass

This repository is an even more experimental "mirror"* of the [experimental aur.git mirror](https://github.com/archlinux/aur).

It takes AUR and does [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NljxtaJv-68)
to create a git repository containing all AUR packages as subdirectories instead of git branches.

Packages are synchronized weekly using a GitHub Action.

## Purpose

- Testing .SRCINFO parsers
- Nuking your PC with hundred thousand PKGBUILDs fast
